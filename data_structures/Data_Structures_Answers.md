Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
  O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
  O(n)? It doesn't seem to have a set size, but the size is directly dependent on the n value

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
  O(n^2)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
  O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
  O(n)

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?
  O(n^2), would be O(c) if we just altered the input array.
