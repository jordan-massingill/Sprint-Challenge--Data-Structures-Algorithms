Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

Exercise I:

a) O(n) - this seems to be linear, since a increases by n squared until it reaches n cubed. Perhaps it's O(n**2) but I don't think so.

b) O(n^3)

c) O(n) - this function looks similar to the Fibonacci seq function, but when played out, it will always return 2n.

Exercise II:

Start throwing eggs off every 3rd story (depending on building height), starting with the first story and ascending. Once the first egg is broken, a temporary floor f has been found. Then start descending by 1 until the first egg is dropped and doesn't break. The floor above is floor _f_.
